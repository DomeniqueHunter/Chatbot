# Story Teller Plugin
The idea for a new f-list plugin. 


## Flow
1. user talks to bot
2. user starts session
2.1. if no daily session exists create a new one
2.2. if session exists use it
3. play
3.1. when session is over, wrtie points etc to db and inform user


## what commands do we need?
!play - start session
!me - my stats
!leaderboard - leaderboard over all users (with nicknames)
!choice or !c <nr> to make a choice?


## 0. Initial Stage
- insert 100%
- go away 100%


## 1-3 slow
- fuck hard / thrust 100%
- pull out / go away 100%


## 4-5 building up
(hole hold you tight, sucks you)
- fuck slower 95%
- cum 100%
- pull out 60%


## 6-10 tightening
- fuck slower 95%
- cum 80%
- pull out 30%


## 10+ very tight
- try to hold back to get sucked in 60% (-1% every try)
- cum 70% 
- pull out 0% instand fail
